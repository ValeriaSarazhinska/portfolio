            During my trainee experience as a Full Stack developer, I had the
            opportunity to work with a range of technologies including Angular,
            TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I gained hands-on
            experience in developing web applications, implementing frontend
            solutions with Angular and TypeScript, and building robust backend
            systems using Express and MongoDB with the help of Mongoose. It was
            an enriching experience where I had the chance to apply my skills
            and learn new techniques in a professional setting.
